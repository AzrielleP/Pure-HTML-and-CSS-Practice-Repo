#What I'm Using to Learn Web Development

##Guide
Learning web development on your own is not easy. When I first decided to switch careers, I took any free course on YouTube that has the most number of views and good comments. And yeah, these are all crash courses. I took some notes and copied the code on a separate IDE while I'm watching the video. In the end, I learned nothing and recalled nothing. 

Fast forward seven months, I decided to learn front-end web development properly. When I browsed the net on the things that a front-end web developer should know, I was overwhelmed by the amount of learning that I should do. I also didn't have enough money to enroll on a bootcamp or any of the online courses you can see on Udemy. Thankfully, I found a good Front-End Web Developer guide on YouTube. It was a guide by *whatsdev*. 

What I loved about whatsdev's guide is it looks more on the realistic side of learning things, not all the **learn this on x months and you can land a job with xx salary**. It highlights the importance of having a good foundation on the basics and fundamentals of programming, and most especially, **hardwork**. In his guide, he also included free sources where you can learn, which is a very big plus to me. However, his guide doesn't cover website deployment and the scope after that. I learned this on *Traversy Media*'s guide which you can also refer to.

##Learning Resources and Tools from Websites
As I've said on the first part, I used **whatsdev's Front End Web Developer Guide** to have a roadmap on my learning journey. I'm still on the CSS part on his guide, but so far, here's a list of the sources that I used:

**Harvard's CS50 course*
    - Almost all of my classes on Computer Science back in high school and college were boring. But these course is an excemption. It truly deserves its high praise that you can see on the comments and reviews.
    - I only took Week 0 until Week 4 and didn't do any of the problem sets. I figured that I'm going to use the problem sets when I'm learning JavaScript.
    - I may be going back to the Python and SQL lectures whenever I feel like learning these languages.

**MDN*
    - I used all of its tutorials on HTML and CSS. 
    - I still go back to it as a reference when coding.
    - I also used it as a reference for the **Preparation** step in whatsdev's guide. 

**Traversy Media's Git and Github Crash Course*
    - I used this source when I wanted to learn the basics of Git and how to use it.

**Traversy Media's Pure CSS and HTML Hamburger Menu tutorial*
    - I used this source to learn how to create a hamburger menu with only HTML and CSS. This tutorial made me realize how powerful CSS can be.

**Git documentation on Github*
    - I'm still on the process of learning the more advanced stuff in Git using this resource.

**CSS Tricks and StackOverflow*
    - These are my go-to websites when I'm stucked with a problem on CSS.
    - I came to realize that there are a lot of 'solutions' in YouTube that are complete time wasters. I only go to YouTube for reference when I can't find the solution on the sites I listed above.

**CSS Zen Garden*
    - Probably a very old website, I used it just to try some of the stuff that I learned because I'm too lazy to create a random content for a website. I practiced responsive design and flexbox with this website.

**Font Awesome*
    - I use this for icons.

**Google Fonts*
    - I mainly use it to get free fonts.

**Unsplash*
    - For pictures and wallpapers. It's free! Just credit the photographer / owner.



##Tools, Extensions, Productivity
The tools that I used and currently using are all based on the recommendations that I read online (Reddit, YouTube). These tools are just based on my preferences.

**VS Code*
    - I'm using VS Code as my main IDE because of the extensions that I can use on it. 
    **VS Code Extensions**
    - **Live Server**
    - **Prettier - Live Formatter**
    - **Material Theme and Material Theme Icons**
    - **Color Highlight**
    - **Bracket Pair Colorizer**

**Typora*
    - I used Typora to take down notes when I was learning HTML and CSS on MDN. 
    - I fell in love with its minimalist interface and how it layouts the text and code snippets. I came to realize that it was using Markdown, which is an additional learning for me.
    - However, it became too slow when my notes increased.

**Sublime Text*
    - With Typora's issues, I researched a lot of note taking apps / software to replace it. I tried **Simplenote** , **Boostnote**, and **Notion** but they just don't appeal to me.  
    - Now, I'm using Sublime Text for my notes and anything related to markdown. It's no match for Typora's interface, but it has customizable themes and colors which I'm very fond of. Also, it works fast and smooth.

**Microsoft Edge*
    - I switched to the new Edge because my laptop can no longer function with many tabs opened in Chrome. It is built similarly to Chrome, so I had no trouble adapting to a new browser. Although UI-wise, I still prefer Chrome.

**Browser Extensions*
    - This is another plus in Edge. You can use the Chrome's browser extensions in Edge.
    - *ColorZilla* 
        + This is my go to color picker and gradient generator
    - *Marinara*
        + A productivity booster. It reminds me that you should do your work for just 25 minutes, and then take a quick 5 minute break. REPEAT.

**Git Bash*
    - Since I'm a windows user, I use Git Bash instead of cmd. I haven't tried CLI yet (maybe in the future).

**Spotify*
    - It's a no-brainer for me that there should be music playing on the background. I availed the 1 month free trial of Spotify Premium and so far I'm liking it. I usually listen to Lo-Fi or Chillhop Music whenever I'm working.

**Forest*
    - I use the Forest app on my phone whenever I have a hard time focusing on learning.

**Trello*
    - I used Trello for a while when I'm still on the first parts of my learning (CS50 to MDN CSS). I rarely use it now because it's not really effective for me at this point.

**Paper and Pen (or whiteboard and marker)*
    - As they say, nothing beats the traditional pen and paper. Writing my tasks and goals by hand gives me more clarity and focus.
